# Android Data Binding Flow
Hub &amp; Spoke : MVVM pattern

Data Binding can be very useful and powerful in your Android Applications.  This simple example outlines a basic UI paradigm, the Hub Spoke Model.  As you'll see, I've bound the data that is "shared" between UI elements of both Hub and Spoke.  This sucessfully removes oodles of boilderplate code, including zero intent bundles, annoying findViewById calls and kludgy activity callbacks.  When you implement Data Binding in your project, you're decoupling your view from model from viewModel, and making your project much easier to read and understand. Enjoy!
